        <p class="entry-title">Giving Back in the US</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Part 3</p>
        <p class="content">In a March push to donate a meal for every bar sold, KUTOA started one of it’s many projects to give back. This time our meals, on behalf of our supporters, were donated in the form of nearly 6,000 KUTOA Kids Squares to 4 different organizations. Having completed similar projects in the past, KUTOA had already recognized some key standards in looking for the right organization to receive our donation; that the programs be child oriented and clearly making a widespread impact in the local community. With that in mind, we began our search for the perfect organizations to receive our KUTOA Kid Squares.        
        </p>
        <img src="images/blog/bars_closeup_large.jpeg" alt="KUTOA bars" >
        <p class="content">The 3rd organization that KUTOA happily sought out is potentially one of our favorites yet. This is the FIT Program, or Food In Tummies Program of the Junior League of Austin. Simply put, FIT feeds economically disadvantaged children within the Del Valle Independent School District. For Austin, a city considered by many to be one of the most progressive areas of Texas, the necessity and impact of a program like FIT can not be overstated. Inside Austin’s Del Valle ISD, over 96% of children in the district are economically disadvantaged, meaning that 96% of its students are greatly dependent on school meal programs as a source of food security. Outside of the meals they receive at school, these children don’t know when or from where their next meal will come. This notion can be particularly hard to digest when one considers their access to food security once the weekend has arrived. Any time that they aren’t in school the children are food insecure, and that’s where FIT comes in.</p>
        <img src="images/blog/IMG_1083_3_large.jpeg" alt="FIT Program" >
        <p>While it currently remains a small program that only services Hillside Elementary School and Baty Elementary School (both apart of Del Valle ISD), the FIT Program successfully donates over 50,000 backpacks of food to children each year. On every Friday of the school year, FIT goes out to these two schools, backpacks in tow, and distributes backpacks to over 1,600 children, providing for them a source of vital nutrition for the weekend. Nobody could say it better than this 3rd grade student from Hillcrest, who said “Thank you for the food you donated to us; and thank you for filling our empty tummies.". As we said, the nutrition that is provided for these children cannot be overstated. The saying is true, we are what we eat, and this can be especially true for a poorly nourished child. Without adequate food for a child, everything around them is affected, as a result. Their attendance, their overall participation, and their ability to perform and focus on gaining an education all begin to suffer. We’ve all had our days in school when lunch couldn’t come soon enough, and we all know how distracting the voice of hunger can be. It’s for these reasons that KUTOA was proud to partner with the FIT Program, and to silence that hunger in these children’s bellies. As a company devoted to providing the most fundamental necessities for happiness and prosperity, KUTOA couldn’t pass on this opportunity.</p>

        <p class="content">Keeping in mind that we wanted to make our impact beyond one organization, we began to reach out to the FIT Program in order to offer them nearly 800 KUTOA Kid Squares. Made with high quality, whole, all natural non-GMO verified ingredients, the FIT Program happily accepted our donation with great thanks. With this donation, on the behalf of all of our fantastic supporters, over 800 kids within the Del Valle ISD can continue to nourish their minds along with their bodies!</p>

        <p class="content">KUTOA would like to extend its sincerest gratitude towards the FIT Program and the Junior League of Austin for all that they have accomplished and will continue to accomplish for the children of Del Valle ISD. Your crucial role in the educational success of over 1,600 kids can never be overstated.

      <p class="subtitle">Part 2</p>
      <p class="content">Beginning in March, KUTOA started a project to give meals, on behalf of our supporters. As a one-for-one company, every bar you purchase feeds a child in need, either internationally or at home. Depending on the organization and situation the children are facing, KUTOA donates several different types of meals. In this case, we donated our very own Kids Squares. Having completed similar projects in the past, KUTOA had already recognized some key standards in looking for the right organization to receive our donation; that the program be child-oriented and provide the proper nutrition for these children. With that in mind, we began our search for the perfect organizations to receive our KUTOA Kid Squares.</p>   
    <img src="images/blog/CAFBlogo_H4C_woSA_large.jpg" alt="Capital Area Food Bank of Texas" />       
    <p class="content">One of the organizations that we immediately contacted was the <a href="https://www.austinfoodbank.org/" title="Capital Area Food Bank of Texas">Capital Area Food Bank of Texas</a>. Established in 1982 in Austin, the Capital Area Food Bank has long since devoted its resources to fighting hunger in Central Texas. Donating over 31 million pounds of food during the last year alone, the Capital Area Food Bank services over 46,000 hungry people every week, 34% of which are children. Thanks to nearly 17,000 volunteers each year, the Capital Area Food Bank has long remained as a shining example of an organization that is conscious of the needs that surrounds it's community. They have begun to effectively tackle, among many things, a pervasive and often well disguised social issue. With currently over 1 in 4 children in Texas being food insecure, not knowing where or when their next meal will come from, the Capital Area Food Bank has launched specific programs aimed at fostering greater nutrition for the children of Central Texas, programs that have left the KUTOA Team very excited.</p>

    <img src="images/blog/KUTOA_Donation_007_large.JPG" alt="donation" /> 
    <p class="content">One such program is the Kids Café program, which began in 1998 nationwide in collaboration with the organization Feeding America. With the specific intent of teaching children the importance of good nutrition, the Kids Café offers nutritious afterschool and summer-time meals to children ranging from 5-18 years of age. This alternate source of nutrition for children outside of school is of particular importance. As is often the case for children who face food insecurity, their school is their only available source of nutrition. With the Kids Café, children now don’t have to rely solely on schools for their meals, but can seek out other options. This is significantly important come summer time when schools, along with their food programs, are closed. For these reasons, KUTOA immediately recognized the potential to make an impact in the lives of some children who really needed it!</p>    <img src="images/blog/bb_large.jpg" alt="Kids Cafe" />
    <p class="content">Keeping in mind that we wanted to make our impact in more than one organization, we began to reach out to the Capital Area Food Bank of Texas in order to offer them nearly 1,200 KUTOA Kid Squares. Made with high quality, whole, all natural non-GMO verified fruits, nuts, and seeds, the Capital Area Food Bank immediately accepted our donation with a smile. Thanks to this donation, on the behalf of all of our fantastic supporters, nearly 1,200 kids within the Austin area can continue to nourish their lives and bodies.</p>    
    <p class="content">KUTOA would like to extend its gratitude to the Capital Area Food Bank of Texas for all that they have accomplished and will continue to accomplish.

      <p class="content">One organization that we immediately contacted, having donated to it previously in the past, was the Covenant House. Founded in 1972 with the simple, profound mission to help homeless kids escape the streets, the Covenant House has become the largest privately funded charity in the Americas providing loving care and vital services to homeless, abandoned, abused, trafficked, and exploited youth. Serving over 14,000 youth in California  and Texas last year alone, the Covenant House not only offers those in need services like shelter, food and clothing, but also provides for their mental and physical health, as well as programs designed to introduce youth back into schools or the workplace. When studying the details of the Covenant House and what all they provide for homeless youth, KUTOA immediately recognized the potential to make an impact in the lives of some youth who really needed it!</p>

      <p class="content">Keeping in mind that we wanted to make our impact in more than one organization and location, we began to reach out to the Covenant Houses in Hollywood, California and Houston, Texas in order to offer each of them over 1,500 of our own KUTOA Kid Squares. Made with high quality, whole, all natural non-GMO verified ingredients, the Covenant Houses of California and Texas delightedly accepted our donation with open arms. With over 80% of their financing coming from private donations, the Covenant House of California remains extremely appreciative of those who seek out to help their youth. Thanks to our donation, over 3,100 sheltered youth in the US can continue to nourish their lives and bodies.</p>

      <p class="content">KUTOA would like to extend its gratitude towards the Covenant House programs, especially in California and Texas, for all that they have accomplished and will continue to accomplish for youth in certain need of empowerment, guidance, and safety.
